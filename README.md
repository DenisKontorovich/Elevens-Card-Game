 face card is moved to the bottom of the deck, and the card on the top of the deck is placed on the pile. The second move is for the user to choose two cards which add
 up to eleven based on their face value. Face cards have a values less of 0, while aces have a value of 1. If there is an eleven pair then a card from the deck is added to the first 
 pile selected and the second pile selected. Game continues until all twelve of a user's cards have a face card such as king, queen, or jacks, or the user runs out of moves to do.
